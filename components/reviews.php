                        Since working for New Horizon Healthcare Services I can truly say I have felt well looked after andappreciated. I am offered shifts that work around my personal-life and childcare. The team areresponsive and helpful, and even offer me transport if I am struggling to find my own way to a shift to ensure I get there on time.

                        Working for New Horizon has been very enjoyable. I get opportunities to work in a variety of homes which suits me as I like a challenge and new environments. I get paid every Friday and the people in the office are quick to resolve any problems I may have.

                        I work for New Horizon on my days off from my main job as a way to earn some extra money, being part of an agency means I can pick and choose shifts when it’s convenient for me. They offer more pay than I’ve seen other agencies offer and they give me a bonus or free transport when I pick up last-minute shifts.
